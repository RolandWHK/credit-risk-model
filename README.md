# credit-risk-model
The goal of this project is to preprocess banking data then using machine learning models to model PD(Probability of Default), LGD(Loss Given Default) and EAD(Exposure At Default) hence at the end computing EL(Expected Loss) which are key metrics for banks helping them to make money while keeping their business safe.
